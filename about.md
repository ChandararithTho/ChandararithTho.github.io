# About

I am a postgraduate student at the University of Queensland. I am doing a Master of Engineering Science (Management) in Mechatronic Engineering. I am from Cambodia and this is my first semester of the 2-year program. I did my Bachelor's Degree of Science in Technical Education (Mechatronics Engineering) at King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, Thailand. I have work experience at 2 private companies in Thailand before I became a government official at the Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation of Cambodia.

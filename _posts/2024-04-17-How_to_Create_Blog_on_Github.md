Welcome to my first blog. I followed the instructions of Jeremy Howard to create this blog showing how to create a Github Blog step by step. I created this blog just to record what I have done from the very beginning step. 

## Create a repository
•	First, go to https://github.com/ , sign up and create Github account.

•	Then go through Jeremy’s link: https://github.com/fastai/fast_template/generate to create repository by completing the information as follows:

The repository name must follow by “.github.io” as shown above. 

•	Click on the green button “Create Repository”.

### Create contents
•	Click on the “index.md” file. This file is used to create formatted text. 

•	We can edit contents in this file by clicking “edit content” icon on the top-right side and these contents will be shown as the first page to readers. We also can drag and drop a file to add file/photo here. 

•	Click on the green icon “Commit Changes” on the top-right side to save, then click on “Commit Changes” again. 

#### Edit profile
•	Next click on the “_config.yml” file to edit our profile.

•	Edit our title, description, username and contact info in this file by clicking a pencil icon on the top-right corner, then click “commit changes” to save.

•	Wait for Github to process, then we’ll be able to go to the blog site through the URL: “username.github.io”

##### Edit About page

•	We also can edit About Page info by clicking on this “about.md” file and follow the same procedure. Every change requires a minute process for Github to update it on the site. Refresh the page if it’s still not updated. 

This is the end of the blog. Thanks for reading.
